Description: Provides functionality to retrieve msigdb collections. Primary data
    is provided for human entrez identifiers and is entirely provided via the
    functionality in msigdbr. This package provides a bit more versatility
    around identifier mapping to ensembl, and returning data to alternate
    species. This package is here to provide functionality to multiGSEA for
    MSigDB GeneSetDb retrieval (one might even say that it Enhances it(?)).
